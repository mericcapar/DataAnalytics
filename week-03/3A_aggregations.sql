-- (Bonus: Once you have written a working query, try asking Claude or ChatGPT for help
-- using the ROUND function to round the average price to the nearest cent.

-- 5. Write a query to identify the highest salary and the lowest salary amounts which any
-- employee makes. (Just the amounts, not the specific employees!)

-- 6. Write a query to find the name and supplier ID of each supplier and the number of
-- items they supply. Hint: Join is your friend here.

-- 9. Write a query to list products currently in inventory by the product id, product name,
-- and inventory value (calculated by multiplying unit price by the number of units on
-- hand). Sort the results in descending order by value. If two or more have the same
-- value, order by product name. If a product is not in stock, leave it off the list.

SELECT ProductID, ProductName, (UnitPrice * UnitsInStock) AS InventoryValue
